Time of semester may be a factor but only for students, and in particular only for students that are about to get a low note... of course, if selection goes on a voluntarily basis, selection bias may be strong because only students in need (highly motivated, though) will be willing to participate.

Anecdotally, it does often seem to be the case that the more academically committed students complete their credit points earlier in the semester, but I'm not sure if this would empirically hold. I think assessing data at different times of the semester would be a very interesting empirical question to study, though

Also, on a slightly unrelated note, I found the definition of ""well"" and ""poorly"" to be a bit ambiguous in the survey. When I answered the questions, I took ""participants performing the task well"" to mean ""participants providing data that is an accurate reflection of their true nature/ability"". However, after reading the second question about caution, I figure that you actually meant ""participants having high task ability"" (i.e., high drift rate in terms of response time models). Therefore, you may wish to exclude my answers based on this"
