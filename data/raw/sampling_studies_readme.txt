Pilot 1 - (July 2017) examined four difficulty levels x speed/accuracy manipulation. We then realised that the coherent dots remained on the screen for 3 frames instead of one, making the RDM task way easier. Paul fixed this issue. Study 3a and Study 3b

Pilot 2 (Oct 2017) tested a bunch of different difficulty levels in the corrected RDM task to see which four gave the best range of accuracy. Study 4a and Study 4b

Pilot 3 (Dec 2017-Jan 2018) used those four levels and reintroduced the speed/accuracy manipulation. Study 5a and Study 5b

Pilot 4 (Jan 2018) tested 24 different brightness levels to gain a more granulated insight into the effects of brightness needed (the levels from the previous pilots were too easy and too hard). Study 4b (it was updated)

Pilot 5 (Feb 2018) used those four levels and reintroduced the speed/accuracy manipulation. Run on Mech turk. Study 6a and Study 6b
